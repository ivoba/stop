Stop
====

Stop provides nice output for debug functions PHP 5.3+

During developing pretty often i find myself typing:

    print_r($var);exit;

or

    var_dump($var);exit; 

So this lib provides a shortcut plus some more infos, some nice rendering, plenty of options and autoloading to that.

Install
----------
via composer, put this in your require block:  

    "ivoba/stop": "dev-master"

then  

    composer update ivoba/stop



Using Stop
----------

By default, resp. via composer install, Stop will include global functions to ease access to the debug methods

* Functions:
this is probably the fastest way with or without IDE Autocompletion.  
**If you also have functions named *stop* or *stop_dump* *_s* or *_sd* in your project: rename them, dude! No mercy!** or use the class ;) 
   
```stop($var);```

or even shorter

```_s($var);```

this will output print_r($var) in a code block and will exit the script

```stop_dump($var);```

or even shorter

```_sd($var);```

this will output var_dump($var) in a code block and will exit the script

* Static Class Methods:

   ```\Stop\Stop::it($var, $continue, $hide, \Stop\Stop::VAR_DUMP);```

* OO Style:

   ```$Stop = new \Stop\Stop(\Stop\Stop::ENV_DEV);  
   $Stop->printr($var);  
   $Stop->dump($var)```


###TODO

- FirePHP
- render backtrace?
- render code context 

any ideas? contribute!
